44 The marginal effectiveness variables are calculated as the difference between the actual calculated net income and what the net income would have been without the deduction. Because the combined value of deductions a unit is entitled to sometimes exceeds the gross income received by the unit, the marginal effectiveness variables give a more accurate picture of the impact of the deductions.
